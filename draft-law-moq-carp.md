--- abstract

This document updates [WARP] by defining a new optional feature for the streaming format.
It specifies the syntax and semantics for adding CMAF-packaged media [CMAF] to WARP.

# Introduction

CARP Streaming Format (CARP) is a media format designed to deliver CMAF [CMAF] and
LOC [LOC] compliant media content over MOQ Transport (MOQT) [MoQTransport]. CARP extends
WARP and retains all the scope, capabilities and features of WARP including the catalog
format, timeline, ABR switching and LOC support. CARP is targeted at real-time and
interactive levels of live latency, as well as VOD content.

This document describes version 1 of the CARP streaming format.

# WARP Extension
All of the specifications, requirements, and terminology defined in [WARP] apply to
implementations of this extension unless explicitly noted otherwise in this document.

# CMAF Packaging

## Initialization headers
A CMAF header is a sequence of CMAF constrained ISO BMFF boxes that do not reference any
media samples, but are associated with a CMAF track and are necessary for initializing
the decoding of the subsequent CMAF fragments.

The header for a given MOQT Track MUST be packaged by encoding the header using [BASE64]
and then inserting that payload as the value of the Initialization data "initData" field
in the catalog entry for that Track.

## Switching sets and tracks
This specification defines a direct mapping between CMAF Tracks ( [CMAF] Sect 3.2.1) and
MOQT tracks ([MoQTransport] Sect 2.3).

CMAF switching sets are a set of one or more CMAF tracks (3.2.1), where each track is an
alternative encoding of the same source content and are constrained to enable seamless
track switching (3.3.9).

Each CMAF track in a switching set MUST be transmitted as a separate MOQT Track. The
catalog entry for each of these tracks in the switching set MUST carry a Alternate group
(altGroup) key with a common value.

The MOQT Group numbers within these switching set tracks MUST be media time-aligned.
Mandating the track being media time-aligned requires that the presentation time of the
first media sample contained within the first MOQT Object of each MOQT Group is identical.

## Object Packaging

The payload of each Object is subject to the following requirements:

* MUST contain at least one Movie Fragment Box (moof) followed by a Media Data
  Box (mdat). This is equivalent to requiring that each Object hold at least one CMAF
  Chunk. The Media Fragment Box (moof) MUST contain a Movie Fragment Header Box
  (mfhd) and Track Box (trak) with a Track ID (track_ID) matching a Track Box in the
  initialization fragment.
* MAY contain multiple successive CMAF Chunks.
* MUST contain a single [ISOBMFF] track.
* MUST contain media content encoded in decode order.

## Group Packaging

Each MOQT Group

* MUST begin with an Object containing a stream access point (SAP type 1 or 2).
* MUST contain one or more contiguous Groups of Pictures (GOPs).
* The Group boundary MUST align with a CMAF Fragment boundary. CMAF Fragments and CMAF
  Chunks MUST not span Groups.

## Catalog description

### CMAF packaging type
This specification extends the allowed packaging values defined in WARP Section 5.1.12
to include one new entry, as defined in Table 1 below:

| Name              |   Value         |      Reference        |
|:==================|:================|:======================|
| CMAF              | cmaf            | This RFC              |

Every Track entry in a CARP catalog carrying CMAF-packaged media data MUST declare a
"packaging" type value of "cmaf".

### Max SAP starting types
This specification adds two track-level catalog fields, as defined in Table 2 below:

| Field                       |  Name                  |           Definition      |
|:============================|:=======================|:==========================|
| Max Group SAP starting type | maxGrpSapStartingType  | {{maxgrpsapstartingtype}} |
| Max Object SAP starting type| maxObjSapStartingType  | {{maxobjsapstartingtype}} |

#### Max Group SAP starting type {#maxgrpsapstartingtype}
Location: T    Required: Optional   JSON Type: Number

A number indicating the maximum SAP type the MOQT Groups in the track start with.

#### Max Object SAP starting type {#maxobjsapstartingtype}
Location: T    Required: Optional   JSON Type: Number

A number indicating the maximum SAP type the MOQT Objects in the track start with.

## Event Timelines

### SAP Type timeline {#saptypetimeline}
CARP defines a special instance of an Event Timeline track, termed the SAP Type timeline
track. Its purpose is to convey information about the distribution of Stream Access Point
types and their associated Earlist Presentation Times.

In the catalog, the SAP-type timeline track MUST include a 'packaging' value of 'eventtimeline"
and MUST include an 'eventType' value of 'org.ietf.moq.carp.sap'.

In the SAP Type timeline JSON payload:

* The index reference MUST be 'l' for Location
* The data field is a JSON Array containing two integers. The first integer defines SAP type
  with an allowed value of 0,1,2 or 3. The value 0 indicates that the Object does not start
  with an ISOBMFF stream access point. The value equal to 1, 2, or 3 indicates that the Object
  begins with a stream access point of SAP type 1, 2, or 3, respectively. When the Object is
  the first Object in the Group, the value MUST be equal to 1 or 2. The second integer defines
  the earliest media presentation timestamp, rounded to the nearest millisecond, of all media
  samples in the Object defined by the Location of that record.

### SAP-type timeline track example
This shows an example of 30-fps HEVC-encoded content, in which each 4s Group beings with
SAP-type 2 (i.e., the first picture in the Group is an IDR picture, while there may be one or more
pictures in the Group following the IDR picture in decoding order but preceding it in output
order). After 2 seconds in each Group, there is a SAP-type 3, i.e., a CRA picture, which
is associated with one or more Random Access Skipped
Leading (RASL) pictures. A small buffer of frames (10 frames at 30 fps) is skipped/discarded
(RASL pictures) when the streaming session starts from the SAP-type 3 location. In this example,
the EPT is the presentation time of the first picture after the RASL pictures in decoding order;
all pictures after the RASL pictures can be fully correctly decoded and are thus presentable
when the streaming session starts from the SAP-type 3 location. Note that if the streaming session
starts from the start of the Group, then these RASL pictures can be fully correctly decoded and are
thus presentable.
