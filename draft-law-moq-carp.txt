1.  Introduction

   CARP Streaming Format (CARP) is a media format designed to deliver
   CMAF [CMAF] and LOC [LOC] compliant media content over MOQ Transport
   (MOQT) [MoQTransport].  CARP extends WARP and retains all the scope,
   capabilities and features of WARP including the catalog format,
   timeline, ABR switching and LOC support.  CARP is targeted at real-
   time and interactive levels of live latency, as well as VOD content.

   This document describes version 1 of the CARP streaming format.

2.  WARP Extension

   All of the specifications, requirements, and terminology defined in
   [WARP] apply to implementations of this extension unless explicitly
   noted otherwise in this document.

3.  CMAF Packaging

3.1.  Initialization headers

   A CMAF header is a sequence of CMAF constrained ISO BMFF boxes that
   do not reference any media samples, but are associated with a CMAF
   track and are necessary for initializing the decoding of the
   subsequent CMAF fragments.

   The header for a given MOQT Track MUST be packaged by encoding the
   header using [BASE64] and then inserting that payload as the value of
   the Initialization data "initData" field in the catalog entry for
   that Track.

3.2.  Switching sets and tracks

   This specification defines a direct mapping between CMAF Tracks (
   [CMAF] Sect 3.2.1) and MOQT tracks ([MoQTransport] Sect 2.3).

   CMAF switching sets are a set of one or more CMAF tracks (3.2.1),
   where each track is an alternative encoding of the same source
   content and are constrained to enable seamless track switching
   (3.3.9).

   Each CMAF track in a switching set MUST be transmitted as a separate
   MOQT Track.  The catalog entry for each of these tracks in the
   switching set MUST carry a Alternate group (altGroup) key with a
   common value.

   The MOQT Group numbers within these switching set tracks MUST be
   media time-aligned.  Mandating the track being media time-aligned
   requires that the presentation time of the first media sample
   contained within the first MOQT Object of each MOQT Group is
   identical.

3.3.  Object Packaging

   Each MOQT Group MUST begin with a stream access point (SAP type 1 or
   2).  Each MOQT Object MUST hold one or more CMAF Chunks.  The payload
   of each Object is subject to the following requirements:

   *  MUST consist of a Segment Type Box (styp) followed by any number
      of media fragments.  Each media fragment consists of a Movie
      Fragment Box (moof) followed by a Media Data Box (mdat).  The
      Media Fragment Box (moof) MUST contain a Movie Fragment Header Box
      (mfhd) and Track Box (trak) with a Track ID (track_ID) matching a
      Track Box in the initialization fragment.

   *  MUST contain a single [ISOBMFF] track.

   *  MUST contain media content encoded in decode order.

3.4.  Catalog description

   This specification extends the allowed packaging values defined in
   WARP Section 5.2.10 to include a new entry, as defined in Table 1
   below:

                       +======+=======+===========+
                       | Name | Value | Reference |
                       +======+=======+===========+
                       | CMAF | cmaf  | This RFC  |
                       +------+-------+-----------+

                                 Table 1

   Every Track entry in a CARP catalog MUST declare a "packaging" type
   value of "cmaf".

3.5.  Timeline description

   This specification extends the METADATA element of the timeline
   track, defined in WARP Section 7, in the following four aspects:

   *  Specification of a general scheme for metadata signalled through
      the METADATA element of the timeline track [Ed.Note: This aspect
      should also be applied to WARP, thus should be moved to WARP later
      on.]

   *  Definition of a namespace for CARP-specific metadata signalled
      through the METADATA element of the timeline track

   *  Addition of metadata signalling of SAP type

   *  Addition of metadata signalling of earliest presentation time

3.5.1.  General metadata scheme

   When not empty, the string in the METADATA field MUST contain one or
   more comma separated key=value pairs, formatted as Strings as
   specified in Section 3.3.3 of [RFC9651].  For example, the METADATA
   field can be "key1=1,key2=3268".  For another example, the METADATA
   field can be "key1=1,key2=""hello-world"",key3=3268".

   A key name MAY be prefixed with a namespace.  When a namespace is
   present, the separator between the namespace prefix and the key name
   is '.'.

3.5.2.  Namespace for CARP-specific metadata signalled through the
        METADATA element

   For CARP-specific metadata signalled through the METADATA element,
   the namespace is "timeline:metadata:carp".

3.5.3.  Metadata signalling of SAP type

   When the key name of a key=value pair is "SAP_TYPE", the value
   indicates the SAP type the Object begins with.  The namespace-
   prefixed key is "timeline:metadata:carp.SAP_TYPE".

   The value 0 indicates that the Object does not start with an ISOBMFF
   stream access point.  The value equal to 1, 2, or 3 indicates that
   the Object begins with a stream access point of SAP type 1, 2, or 3,
   respectively.  When the Object is the first Object in the Group, the
   value MUST be equal to 1 or 2.

3.5.4.  Metadata signalling of earliest presentation time

   When the key name of a key=value pair is "EARLIEST_PTS", the value
   indicates the earliest media presentation timestamp rounded to the
   nearest millisecond of all media samples in the Object.  The
   namespace-prefixed key is "timeline:metadata:carp.SAP_TYPE".

   WWhen the SAP type the Object begins with is 2 or 3, the EARLIEST_PTS
   key SHOULD be present.

4.  Catalog Examples

   The following section provides non-normative JSON examples of various
   catalogs compliant with this draft.

4.1.  Simulcast video tracks - 3 alternate video qualities along with
      audio

   This example shows catalog for a media producer capable of sending 3
   time-aligned video tracks for high definition, low definition and
   medium definition video qualities, along with an audio track.
